## Launch Week (March 1–7)

### March 1 — Launch Day (Facebook + Instagram)

**Facebook:**

> Youth hockey decisions are expensive and confusing. Most of what families need to make them — real experiences, honest information about teams and coaches — is scattered across texts, group chats, and word of mouth.
>
> We're in a foundational phase of building transparency for parents. Profiles, events, facilities, and schools in one place. No hype, no pressure. Just clarity.
>
> If this is useful to your family, free accounts are open at myhockeyrecruiting.com

**Instagram (hook in first line):**

> Youth hockey decisions are expensive. And most of what families need to make them isn’t easy to find.

> We’re building transparency for parents — profiles, events, facilities, schools. Foundational phase. Free accounts open.

### March 3 — Standalone Tip (Facebook)

**Facebook:**

> The most important information in youth hockey is rarely public. Which coaches develop players well. Which programs are worth the cost. What other families actually experienced.
>
> That gap creates stress. Parents fill it with guessing.
>
> The antidote isn’t more hype. It’s more transparency. If you want clarity for your family, we’re here.

**Instagram:**

> The best info in youth hockey usually stays private. Coaches, programs, real experiences — most parents are guessing.
>
> Transparency helps. Calm, grounded, no hype. Link in bio.

> Most parents are guessing when it comes to youth hockey tryouts. What to expect. How to prepare. What happens after.
>
> Our guide breaks down the basics: what to ask, what to watch for, and how to support your child through the process. No drama, no fear-mongering. Just clarity.
>
> If this resonated, pass it to another hockey parent. Full post: [link]

>
> Informed decisions come from real information — not pressure, not urgency.
>
> This is for parents who want clarity. Free accounts are open.

## March Week 2 (March 8–14)

### March 8 — Blog Share: AAA vs AA (if blog post is live)

**Facebook:**

> AAA vs AA hockey — the labels sound simple. The reality is anything but. Different regions, different expectations, different costs.
>
> We broke down what the tiers actually mean and when each might be the right fit. Not “which is better,” but “what makes sense for your family.”
>
> Read the full post: [link]. If it helps, share with another hockey parent.

### March 10 — Standalone Tip (Facebook)

**Facebook:**

>
> Clarity reduces anxiety. Not by promising outcomes, but by making the landscape visible.
>
> If you’re tired of guessing, we’re here.

### March 12 — Cost of Youth Hockey (Facebook)

>
> No one wants to be surprised. Or to feel like they’re spending blindly.
>
> Transparency around costs helps families plan and decide. That’s part of what we’re building. Free accounts open.

## March Week 3 (March 15–21)

### March 15 — Youth Hockey Levels (Facebook)

**Facebook:**

> Youth hockey levels can feel like a secret code. U8, U10, U12. Tier 1, Tier 2. Every region does it slightly differently.
>
> The goal isn’t to memorize labels. It’s to understand what they mean for development, cost, and fit.
>
> We’re building resources for parents who want that clarity. Free accounts open.

### March 17 — Standalone Tip (Facebook)

**Facebook:**

>
> This is for parents who want clarity without hype.

## March Week 4 (March 22–31)

### March 24 — Standalone Tip (Facebook)

**Facebook:**

> Misinformation travels fast in youth hockey. “You have to make AAA by 12.” “If you don’t travel, you’re done.” A lot of it is noise.
>
> Clarity comes from real experiences, not rumors.
>
> We’re building a place for that. Free accounts open.

## April Week 1 (April 1–7)

### April 1 — Post-Tryout Season (Facebook)

### April 3 — Development Over Labels (Facebook)

**Facebook:**

>
> That’s hard to remember when everyone around you is comparing labels.
>
> We believe in development over labels. If that resonates, we’re here.
